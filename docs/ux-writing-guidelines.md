# UX Writing Guidelines

## Tone

- Calm, clear, supportive.
- Keep Dutch phrasing short and action-oriented.
- Prefer direct verbs over abstract language.

## Form and feedback rules

- Error copy explains what happened and what to do next.
- Success copy confirms completion and next best action.
- Loading copy is brief and specific (for example, `Inzichten laden…`).

## Button and CTA rules

- Primary CTA labels use verbs (`Opslaan`, `Opnieuw proberen`).
- Avoid vague labels like `Doorgaan` if a clearer action exists.
- Keep one visual primary CTA per section.

## Empty state rules

- Explain why the state is empty.
- Offer one clear next step.
- Keep emotional tone neutral-positive.
