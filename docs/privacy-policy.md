# Privacy Policy (Inchecken)

Last updated: 2026-02-21

## What data we process

- Account data for authentication (handled by Supabase Auth).
- Check-in content you create (thoughts, emotions, body signals, energy, behavior metadata).
- Operational telemetry for product quality:
  - Web vitals metrics
  - Basic app events (for example login success, onboarding completion, check-in save actions)

## Why we process data

- To provide core app functionality (sign-in, save and display check-ins).
- To keep the app stable, fast, and secure.
- To understand high-level product usage and improve UX.

## Data processors and infrastructure

- Supabase: authentication and application data.
- Vercel: hosting, runtime, and performance insights.

## Retention and deletion

- User content remains until removed by the user or account owner.
- Operational telemetry is retained only for operational analysis windows.
- Users can request account/content deletion through support/admin flow.

## Security measures

- Row-Level Security (RLS) for check-in data access.
- Strict transport and browser security headers.
- Input validation/sanitization on check-in payloads.

## Your rights

- Access: request data overview.
- Correction: update profile/check-in data in app.
- Deletion: request account and related data removal.
